Simply my work from campus that I am going to modify so it can be put on
 any server within seconds of running a start script


To do list of items:<br>
1. Replace all username and passwords with generic ones<br>
2. Replace all https://acadweb1.salisbury.ed.... to generic [Web address]<br>
3. Possibly create a script that completes items 1 and 2?<br>
4. Create a script that changes the generic username and password, web address to one selectable by a user.<br>
   (Try to write in Python? Find and replace script?)<br>
5. Modify the SQL Code so that way the database structure is created but not the database items or make an option<br>
   to load one but not the other<br>
6. Possibly remove the connection string that is present in almost all of the php pages and create a connection.php<br>
   page to add protection<br>
7. Any ideas on how to make the whole thing a lot cooler?
