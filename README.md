Simply my work from campus that I am going to modify so it can be put on
 any server within seconds of running a start script


To do list of items:<br>
1. Replace all username and passwords with generic ones
2. Replace all https://acadweb1.salisbury.ed.... to generic [Web address]
3. Possibly create a script that completes items 1 and 2?
4. Create a script that changes the generic username and password, web address to one selectable by a user.
   (Try to write in Python? Find and replace script?)
5. Modify the SQL Code so that way the database structure is created but not the database items or make an option
   to load one but not the other
6. Possibly remove the connection string that is present in almost all of the php pages and create a connection.php
   page to add protection
7. Any ideas on how to make the whole thing a lot cooler?
